<h2>CadetNav-Physics</h2>
&emsp;
In my third year of studies at the Faculty of Navigation and Naval Management, Maritime and Fluvial Transport specialization, at the 'Mircea cel Bătrân' Naval Academy, I had the opportunity to create a project 
that I presented at CadetNav, a conference attended by representatives from various universities. Given my specialization in engineering, I decided to develop a C++ script that addresses physics problems related 
to electricity. The project is designed to be accessible even to those unfamiliar with physics, helping them calculate parameters such as equivalent resistance in series or parallel circuits, electric current intensity, 
electromotive force, equivalent electromotive force, and voltage across a resistor. For developing this program, I used Visual Studio Code as my integrated development environment (IDE).
